# flappy-learning
The aim of the project is to develop a reinforced learning Flappy Bird clone.
The interface of the game is based on the helicopter game develop previously with adjusted physics. Sprites were not changed for simplicity.
The original game code can be viewed and played here: https://github.com/Marcin-Bak1/python_graphic

The base learning algorithm is Q-learning.
